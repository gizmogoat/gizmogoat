## Gorilla Tag projects update (2)
I'm officially done. Everything is abandoned and archived.

This game's developers and its community has been treating developers like total trash, taking advantage of talented and intellegent community members for profit as they ignore their requests and concerns and pretend like they're the face of good development in VR.
This game's content quality has been drastically dropping over the last 2 years as of halfway through 2025, rushing out untested and unfinished updates for yet another round of cosmetics and bundles to incentivize people to buy ingame currency. 
They don't do a good job, because its more profitable to cut corners and push out trash than it is to make quality content.
Their behavior has been pushing knowledgeable and well-intented community developers towards cheating, because the official spaces shunt you for trying to exist and have fun with other people. For example, in the past, me and dev9998 was banned from the modding server just because a cheater happened to join us and make a video with us in it, under the guise of "working with them"! This is, unarguably, **absolutely fucking insane** and directly hostile to people just trying to have fun with their hobby.


You might not listen to my plead, but please consider:

**Do not support Another Axiom financially.** They feed you terrible, untested, and duct-taped together content cutting as many corners as possible just to make profit margins. 
**Behaviour like this is killing VR as a gaming medium**, and similar behavior has been slowly deteriorating the gaming scene for years.

If you make mods yourself, I advise you to follow suit with my descision. I do not envision modding being possible for much longer, because AA doesn't care. The biggest reason they still continue to allow modding, from a corporate standpoint, is for competitive communities. Comp communities use mods to preform things like casting and MMR calculations, which bring in more players and therefore more money for AA in a way that our mods don't. They're actively adding more tools for comp communities, likely to slowly creep towards backstabbing us and implementing something like EAC, just like VRChat has. I have seen this play out once already and I imagine I will see it play out again.

Thank you to everyone who has enjoyed and supported any of my projects over these past 3 and a half years. It's been one hell of a ride, but every rollercoaster comes to an end eventually. <3

## A post mortem
This is a follow-up post to the above. As of the 23rd of June, Another Axiom has created an in-depth FaQ of what they like and dislike in terms of modding, and eased their stance on it. I imagine this is due in part because of my modding departure, and my exhaustive announcement regarding my problems of the game. This is a lot better than before, and I will give credit where credit is due, but it may be in part a panic response to the above as I did ping most people in a Discord server of ~20,000 people with the contents of the above text.

I would like to point out that Another Axiom, as one of the largest VR game development companies currently, still views things in the lens of a corporate environment. They are still out to make maximum profit margins off their players, just as any corporation would in late-stage capitalism. Be careful about what you spend your money on and make informed financial descisions in the future. Next time you go to buy Shiny Rocks or a bundle, think: "Is the amount of money I'm spending proportional to the amount of fun I recieve? Could I get something that would benefit me (or the recipient of my money) more than this?"

You may begin to realize that you can get a lot more fun out of that money spent elsewhere. Gorilla Tag is free to play, and you will get basically just as much fun out of the game without any cosmetics. Lots of indie developers are out there, making fantastic games out of their own love for creating fun stuff, and your money would be way more impactful supporting a small developer rather than the largest game dev studio in the entire VR space. Virtual currency systems like the ones AA uses in their games are psychologically designed to make you not realize how much money you're actually spending.

As for the game itself, it's still largely over-bloated and filled with unneccesary and shallow content. I still firmly believe that this game was at its peak in 2021 as an indie game, and that it will never return to its simplistic origins where everything was focused and carefully tested, because doing that isn't the most profitable way they can do it.

All in all, modding might be a bit better for the time being, but I would still be cautious in the future considering how Another Axiom has treated us in the past. Another Axiom will always be in it for the money because that's just how things are in our capitalistic world. I still envision Another Axiom putting Easy AntiCheat on Gorilla Tag in the coming years.

For the record, AA's stance shift will not bring me back to modding. They have demonstrated time and time again that they did not care about my hobby, so I still don't trust them, and I advise you not to immediately trust them because of this either. Corporations are generally not your friend, and Another Axiom is no exception. I would like to add that AA's general manager worked at EA for 8 years, and David Y. worked at EA for 10. Some of the people running this company are corporate big-wigs through and through, and they are conditioned to make as much money from you as possible.

If you wish to maintain any of my projects, you are more than welcome to do so under the terms of the license files in the associated repositories. I believe that free and public access to information is a fundamental human right, my code included.
