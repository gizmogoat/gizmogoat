## Gorilla Tag projects update (2)
I'm officially done. Everything is abandoned and archived.

This game's developers and its community has been treating developers like total trash, taking advantage of talented and intellegent community members for profit as they ignore their requests and concerns and pretend like they're the face of good development in VR.
This game's content quality has been drastically dropping over the last 2 years as of halfway through 2025, rushing out untested and unfinished updates for yet another round of cosmetics and bundles to incentivize people to buy ingame currency. 
They don't do a good job, because its more profitable to cut corners and push out trash than it is to make quality content.
Their behavior has been pushing knowledgeable and well-intented community developers towards cheating, because the official spaces shunt you for trying to exist and have fun with other people. For example, in the past, me and dev9998 was banned from the modding server just because a cheater happened to join us and make a video with us in it, under the guise of "working with them"! This is, unarguably, **absolutely fucking insane** and directly hostile to people just trying to have fun with their hobby.


You might not listen to my plead, but please consider:

**Do not support Another Axiom financially.** They feed you terrible, untested, and duct-taped together content cutting as many corners as possible just to make profit margins. 
**Behaviour like this is killing VR as a gaming medium**, and similar behavior has been slowly deteriorating the gaming scene for years.

If you make mods yourself, I advise you to follow suit with my descision. I do not envision modding being possible for much longer, because AA doesn't care. The biggest reason they still continue to allow modding, from a corporate standpoint, is for competitive communities. Comp communities use mods to preform things like casting and MMR calculations, which bring in more players and therefore more money for AA in a way that our mods don't. They're actively adding more tools for comp communities, likely to slowly creep towards backstabbing us and implementing something like EAC, just like VRChat has. I have seen this play out once already and I imagine I will see it play out again.

Thank you to everyone who has enjoyed and supported any of my projects over these past 3 and a half years. It's been one hell of a ride, but every rollercoaster comes to an end eventually. <3
